# Matcher

This was supposed to be a library that I was going to release to the Unity 3d asset store, and just never got around to.  It'd probably be more beneficial as an open source project, so please feel free to use and/or modify.

## Goal

Matcher is a library that allows for match-many logic in a tile based game, similar to titles like Dungeon Raid or Puzzle Craft.
